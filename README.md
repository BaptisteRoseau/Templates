# Templates

My personal templates used to set up new environments, VSCodium configuration files, home directory configs and language-specific templates.

What you may find useful are:

- [vscodium](vscodium): The VSCodium configuration and extensions
- [languages](languages): The language-specific project templates
- [containers](containers): Container images templates both for CI and for production
- [cicd](cicd): CI/CD pipeline templates

The other scripts are very specific to my setup, it so may be Terraformed later.
